[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)

This year I'm trying to actually comment my code to know what, or mostly why, I did some of the thing in the way that I actually did some of the things...

I'm not really a Rustacean, but I am really getting to like it :)

Obviously asking some AI for help and review, but I'm actually coding myself...

> Day 1 - Secret Entrance (The one with the clock)
<br>Some different variations, but nothing fancy

> Day 2 - Gift Shop (The one with the product IDs)
<br>Low performance string stuff in part 1, a bit more mathy part 2

> Day 3 - Lobby (The one with the battery **jolt**ages)
<br>Super slow solution for part 1 with strings and characters and parsing to switch types
<br>Way more performant byte stuff in part 2
